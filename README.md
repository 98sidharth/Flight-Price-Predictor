# Flight-Price-Predictor
Flight Price Predictor  is a repository containing code for predicting flight prices using machine learning techniques. The repository typically includes a set of data, code, and documentation for building and training machine learning models to predict future flight prices based on historical data.

The repository typically includes various types of data, including flight data and airline pricing data. This data is typically collected from multiple sources, such as airline websites and travel booking platforms. The data can be in different formats, such as CSV, JSON, or SQL, and can include a range of features, such as departure and arrival airports, departure and arrival times, number of stops, airline carriers, and more.

The code in the repository is typically written in Python and uses machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, random forests, and deep neural networks. The code is designed to help developers build and train models that can predict future flight prices based on the historical data. The models can be used for a range of applications, such as providing customers with more accurate flight prices, helping airlines and travel companies with revenue optimization, and providing more accurate travel planning experiences.

In addition to the code and data, the repository typically includes documentation on how to use the code, how to train and evaluate models, and how to deploy the models for use in real-world applications.
